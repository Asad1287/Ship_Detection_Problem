# Ship_Detection_Problem
Ship detection problem refers to the task of identifying the presence of ships in satellite or aerial images of maritime environments. 
It is an important problem for marine authorities for several reasons

Safety and security: Ship detection can be used to monitor and detect illegal activities such as smuggling, piracy, or illegal fishing. It can also help authorities to identify potential safety hazards such as ships in distress or collisions.

Maritime traffic management: Ship detection can help to monitor and manage the movement of ships in busy ports, shipping lanes, and other maritime environments. It can also provide valuable information about the number, size, and types of ships that are passing through a particular area.

Environmental monitoring: Ship detection can be used to monitor and track the movement of ships that may be polluting the marine environment. It can also be used to monitor the movement of wildlife and habitats in sensitive marine environments.

Search and rescue operations: Ship detection can help to locate missing ships or vessels in distress, enabling authorities to respond quickly and effectively to emergency situations.
